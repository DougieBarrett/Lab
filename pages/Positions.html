        <h3><b>Quantifying variability in attentional control as a neurocognitive marker of Schizophrenia using pupil
                frequency tagging and steady-state evoked potentials</b></h3>

        <p>
            Disturbances of attentional control are considered a key symptom of schizophrenia (SZ).
            Evidence for attentional deficits is usually inferred using tasks that compare the ability to select or inhibit
            stimuli in the visual field. Contrasts between individuals with and without SZ on these tasks are typically
            based on summary statistics that aggregate responses across multiple trials. Whilst informative, these analyses
            are insensitive to fluctuations in attentional control that occur at smaller time intervals, for example on a
            trial-by-trial basis.<br/><br/>Recent evidence suggests attentional control is mediated by interactions between neural
            networks that prioritize external or internal stimuli over time. Connectivity between these networks fluctuates,
            with lapses of attention during task performance reflecting competitive interactions between the internally
            directed default mode and externally directed dorsal and ventral attentional systems. Resting state fMRI data
            indicate SZ is associated with changes in the connectivity between these networks, which is thought to underlie
            symptomatic dissociations between self-representation, salience, and task-oriented endogenous attention to
            external stimuli. SZ-related fluctuations in connectivity between networks should elicit measurable interference
            on tasks that require the ongoing evaluation of external visual input.<br/><br/> The objective of this studentship is to
            evaluate the sensitivity and reliability of time-locked changes in sustained attention as a measure of network
            connectivity in SZ and controls. To do this, the project will investigate the relationship between clinical
            symptoms of SZ and trial-by-trial variability in behavioral, pupillometric, and electrophysiological measures of
            performance on tasks that measure the consistency of visual selective attention over short periods of time.

            <b>2) Cognition across the lifespan, the influence of sleep and exercise on sustained attention and
                proactive control in young, middle-age and older adults</b>
        </h3>

        <p>
            <b>Background:</b> There is a growing awareness of the impact of lifestyle factors on mental health and cognition
            across the adult lifespan. Modifiable behaviours such as sleep duration, levels of physical activity and
            sedentary time have been associated with variability in cognitive health in young, middle age and older
            adults. Cognitive abilities are mediated by the structure and functional capacity of the brain. Adequate
            sleep and engagement in regular physical activity are thought to improve cognitive health and neural
            processes, such as neuroplasticity, through molecular upregulation of cellular processes, synchronised
            neural firing and increased cerebral blood flow. Much of the evidence for links between lifestyle factors
            and cognitive health comes from studies that have focussed on clinical groups or outcomes in response to
            prescribed diets, physical activity programmes or sleep deprivation. Few studies, however, have investigated
            the combined influence of sleep and different physical activity modalities on neuroplasticity and its
            influence on specific measures of sustained attention, which are though to mediate the ability to prioritise
            and respond flexibly to changes in the physical and social environment.
            <br /><br />

            <b>Objetive:</b> The project will investigate the way that sleep, sedentary time and different forms of physical
            activity (i.e., aerobic and resistance) interact to influence neural function via changes in the speed of
            sensory processing and individual’s capacity to sustain attentional control. To do this, the study will use
            cutting-edge statistical methods to model interactions between self-report measures of sleep, physical
            activity and different types of exercise, and their impact on sensory processing and sustained attention
            using behavioural, eye tracking and electrophysiological measures. To assess these interactions at different
            stages of the adult lifespan, the study will recruit cohorts of young, middle-aged and older adults who have
            recently enrolled in a gym or fitness class. <br/><br/>The aims of the study are:

            <li>
                Identify and recruit a cohort of inactive young (&lt; 25 years), middle-aged, and older adults (&gt; 65
                years) who intend to, or have recently joined a gym or fitness class with the aim of improving their
                physical fitness.

            <li>
                Use a mixture of diary-based and accelerometer-acquired data to conduct a compositional data analysis to
                quantify the allocation of time to sleep, physical activity engagement and sedentary time in each cohort
                during a twelve-week period following enrolment to a gym or fitness class
            </li>
            <li>
                Evaluate the sensitivity of recently developed measures of sustained attention using cue-related changes
                in the modulation of the pupil light response and the accuracy of smooth pursuit eye movements during
                short-periods of ongoing cognitive activity
            </li>
            <li>
                Integrate the tasks above in a cognitive test battery to measure variability in individuals’ speed of
                processing, sustained attention and inhibitory control using behavioural, eye movement and steady state
                evoked visual potentials
            </li>
            <li>
                Model variability in cognitive performance and psychological outcomes in young, middle-aged and older
                adults prior to and after the uptake of their gym membership as a function of sleep patterns and the
                allocation of different forms of physical activity and sedentary behaviour during a twelve-week period
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Supervision:</b> The project will be supervised by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in developing
            lifestyle interventions and measuring mental health outcomes, experimental design, and eye movement and
            electrophysiological measures of sustained attention. The student will combine self-report, behavioural, and
            physiological measures of physical health and cognitive performance to investigate the impact of lifestyle
            choices on each cohort’s cognitive ability. The results will provide new insights into the link between
            different forms of physical activity and the maintenance of core cognitive abilities in response to
            modifiable lifestyle behaviours at different stages of the adult lifespan<br /><br />
